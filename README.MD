# TKOM Project - Warsaw University of Technology

Project name: `XinChao`
Author: Truong Giang Do
Mentor: Wysota Witold

The goal of the project is to write a language interpreter with a syntax similar to Python but with static data type.

The interpreter was written entirely in C++; the libraries used are only standard libraries (C++17 - including std::variant ).
