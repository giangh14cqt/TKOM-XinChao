# TKOM Project - Warsaw University of Technology

Project name: `XinChao` \
Author: Truong Giang Do \
Mentor: Wysota Witold

## Project's topic

The goal of the project is to write a language interpreter with a syntax similar to Python but with static data type.

The interpreter was written entirely in C++; the libraries used are only standard libraries (C++17 - including std::variant ).

```
int n = 1
for n < 5:
    print(n)
    n *= 2
```
